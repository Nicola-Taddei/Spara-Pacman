# Spara-Pacman
A simple video game inspired to pacman, with added features (you can shoot at the ghosts, but they are replicating really fast!)

Here are some screenshots to give you an idea of what I'm talking about :smiley: :

> How to play 🎮

You are the yellow 🟡 and your enemies (which have variable life points, despite you can't predict how many, since they all look equal) the reds 🔴.

Here are the only commands:

### Moving ###
⬆️ --> **W**
<br>
⬇️ --> **S**
<br>
⬅️ --> **A**
<br>
➡️ --> **D**
<br>
<br>
### Firing ###
🔥 ⬆️ --> **U**
<br>
🔥 ⬇️ --> **J**
<br>
🔥 ⬅️ --> **H**
<br>
🔥 ➡️ --> **K**
<br>
<br>
There are a total of **3** levels:
<br>
-purple 🟣
<br>
-black  ⚫
<br>
-green  🟢
<br>

Once you've killed all of the enemies in a level you can pass to the next.

Enjoy :smiley:
